19,* The Parliament also granted the Queen the duties of tonnage and poundage; but this concession was
19,"at that time regarded only as a matter of form, and she had levied these duties before they were voted"
19,"by the Parliament : But there was another exertion of power, which she practised, and which people,"
19,"in this age, from their ignorance of the antient constitution, may be apt to think a little extraordinary"
19,"Her sister, after the commencement of the war with France, had, from her own authority, imposed"
19,"four mariks on each ton of wine imported, and had encreased the poundage a third on all commodities."
19,"Queen Elizabeth continued these impositions as long as she thought convenient. The Parliament, who"
19,"had so good an opportunity of restraining these arbitrary taxes, when they voted the tonnage and"
19,"poundage, thought proper not to make any mention of them. T. hey knew, that the sovereign, during"
19,"that age, pretended to have the sole regulation of foreign trade, and that their intermed ling with that"
19,"prerogative would have drawn on them the severest reproof, if not chastisement. See Forbes, vol. I."
