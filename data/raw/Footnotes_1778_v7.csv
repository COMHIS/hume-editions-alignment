47,"nation found, that there was no time left for relaxation or diversion. Upon"
47,"application, therefore, of the servants and apprentices, the parliament a ppoint-"
47,ed the second Tuesday of every month for play and recreation. Rush. vol. vii.
47,"p. 460. Whitlocke, p. 247. But these institutions, they found great diffi-"
47,culty to execute; and the people were resolved to be merry when they them-
47,"selves pleased, not when the parliament should preseribe it to them. The"
47,"keeping of Christmas holy-days was long a great mark of malignancy, and"
47,"very severely censured by the commons. Whitlocke, p. 286. Even minced"
47,"pyes, which custom had made a Christmas dish among the churchmen, was re-"
47,"garded, during that season, as a profane and superstitious viand by the secta-"
47,ries; though at other times it agreed very well with their stomachs. In the
47,"parliamentary ordinance too, for the observance of the sabbath, they inserted"
47,"a clause for the taking down of may-poles, which they called a heathenish"
47,"vanity. Since we are upon this subject, it may not be amiss to mention,"
47,"that, be side setting apart Sunday for the ordinances, as they called them"
47,the godly had regular meetings on the Thursdays for resolving cases of con-
47,"science, and conferring about their progress in grace. What they were"
47,"chiefly anxious about, was the fixing the precise moment of their conversion"
47,or new birth; and whoever could not ascertain so difficult a point of calcu-
47,"lation, could not pretend to any title to saintship. The profane scholars at"
47,"Oxford, after the parliament became masters of that town, gave to the"
47,"house, in which the zealots assembled, the denomination of Scruple Shops"
47,"The zealots, in their turn, insulted the scholars and professors; and, in-"
47,"truding into the place of lectures, declaimed against human learning, and"
47,challenged the most knowing of them to prove that their calling was from
