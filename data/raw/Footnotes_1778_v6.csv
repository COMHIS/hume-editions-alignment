125,I To show to what degree the nation was inflamed with regard to the Pala-
125,"tinate, there occurs a remarkable story this session. One Floyd, a prisoner in"
125,"the Fleet, a catholic, had dropped some expressions, in private conversation, as"
126,if he were pleased with the misfortunes of the Palatine and his wife. The
126,commons were in a flame; and pretending to be a court of judicature and of
126,"record, proceeded to condemn him to a severe pun shment. The house of"
126,"lords checked this encroachment; and what was extraordinary, considering"
126,"the present humour of the lower house, the latter acquiesced in the sentiments"
126,"of the peers. This is almost the only pretension of the English commons, in"
126,"which they have not prevailed. Happily for the nation, they have been suc-"
126,"cessful in almost all their other claims. See Parliamentary History, vol. v."

204,"able, that so poor a conundrum could not be rejected by any of these three"
