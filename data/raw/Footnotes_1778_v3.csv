33,"h The parliament in 141, exacted of Edward III. that, on the third"
33,"day of every session, the king should resume all the great offices; and that the"
33,ministers should then answer to any accusation that should be brought against
33,"them! Which plainly implies, that, while ministers, they could not be ac-"
33,"cused or impeached in parliament. Henry IV. told the commons, that the"
33,usage of parliament required them to go first through the king's business
33,"in granting supplies; which order the king intended not to alter, Parl. Hist."
33,"vol. ii. p. 65. Upon the whole, it must be allowed, that, according to ancient"
33,"practice and principles, there are at least plausible grounds for all these opi-"
33,"nions of the Judges. It must be remarked, that this affirmation of Henry IV."
33,"was given deliberately, after consulting the house of peers, who were much"
33,"better acquainted with the usage of parliament than the ignorant commons,"
33,"And it has the greater authority, because Henry IV. had made this very"
33,principle a considerable article of charge against his predecessor; and that a
33,very few years before. So ill grounded were most of the imputations thrown
33,on the unhappy Richard!
