255,I To show how much Henry sported with law and common sense; how servilely the Parliament
255,followed all his caprices; and how much both of them were lost to all sentiment of hame; an act ar
255,"passed st this sesfion, declaring, that a precontract should be no ground of annulling a marriages as if"
255,that pretext had not been made use of both in the case of Anne Boleyn and Anne of Cleves. But the
255,Kin g's intention in this law is said to be a design of restoring the princess Elizabeth t her right of e
255,"gitimacy; and it was his character never to look farther than the present object, without regarding he"
255,inconsistency of his conduct. The Parliament made it high treason to deny the dissolution of errys
255,marriage with Anne of Cleves. Herbert.

263,King should appoint by commission. The statates of treason had been extremely multiplied in this
263,reign; and such an expedient saved trouble and charges in trying that crime. The same Parliament
263,erected Ireland ; into a iingdom ; and Henry henceforth annexed the title of Kin g of sreland v ils
263,"other titles. This sefsion, the commons first began the practice of freeing any of their members, who"
263,"were arrested, by a writ issued by the speaker. Formerly it was usual for them to apply for a writ from"

268,"* The persecutions, exercised during James's reign, are not to be ascribed to his bigotry, a vice"
268,"of which he seems to have been as free as Francis the first or the emperor Charles, poth of whom, as"
268,"well as James, shewed, in different periods of their lives, even an inclination to the new doctrines. The"
268,"extremities to which all these princes were carried, proceeded entirely from the fituation of affairs, during"
268,"that age, which rendered it impossible for them to act with greater temper or moderation, after they"
268,had embraced the resolution of supporting the antient establishments. So violent was the propensity of
268,"the times towards innovation, that a toleration of the new preachers was equivalent to a sormed design"
268,"of changing the national religion. And even the greatest friends to liberty of concience have admicted,"
268,"that tho' a sect, which has aiready diffused itself, has a just claim to indulgence, yet may it often be"
268,"consistent with equity as well as sound policy, to repress by severity the first beginnings of schism and"
268,new systems of theology.
