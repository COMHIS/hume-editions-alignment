173,"with so unlimited an authority; such as receiving first all letters from the King's ministers abroad,"

180,"widow was, Jit certain cases, not only permitted, But even enjoined as a positive precept by the Mo."

180,"fined merely to the Jewish nation. The inference is still just, that such a marriage can contain no na"

385,II The pope at first gave cardinal Pole powers to transact only with regard to the past fruits of the
385,church lands; but being admonished of he danger attending any attempt owards * resumption of
385,"the lands, he enlarged the cardinal's power, and granted him authority to ensure the suine possessior"
385,of the church lands to the present proprietors. There was only one ohuse in the cardinal's powers
385,that has given occasion for some speculation. An exception was made of such cases as Pole should
385,think important enough to merit the being comm unicated to the holy see. But Pole simply reuisied
385,the possession of the whole church lands; and his commission had given him fall powers to that pur
385,"pose. See Harleyan Miscellany, vol. vii. p. 264, 266. It is true, some councils have declared, tha"
385,"it exceeds even the power of the pope to alienate any church lands; and the pope, according to hi"
385,"convenience, may either adhere to or recede from this declaration."
