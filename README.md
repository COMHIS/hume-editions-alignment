# Hume's "History of England" edition alignment

To see the initial results as HTML pages, run:
```
make html_output
```

This is still work in progress and serves as a demo of how to
apply the `matrix-align` package. Things to clarify are:
* Which text unit to choose for alignment? (now: pages)
* Which unit to choose for embeddings? (now: sentence, but segmentation errors are common)

The repo uses Git-LFS.
